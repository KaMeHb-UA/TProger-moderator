# Chat History Chache
This is little cache that contains user names, messages count and first message date formatted like next (each at new line and without whitespace):
```
userId - messages count - first message timestamp
```
For example:
```
1233211-12-1537193531
1233212-101-1537156210
```
Then it must be gziped and encoded in base64. Output data is the target you want
